# How to make electric brains

1. SNN's high performance is meaningful when it is implemented in hardware, not when it is implemented in software. In other words, exploring models through software's flexible development capabilities (learning in this process is not more efficient than deep learning) and implementing them in hardware will result in very fast work with small amounts of power consumption. Low power consumption and fast processing capacity are very big advantages in situations where extreme performance, such as drone flight, is required.

2. Because biological mimicry is guaranteed, we can create a network that is completely similar to the real brain. Personally, if artificial intelligence comes out that plays a role similar to the real brain, it will be a completely SNN-based network.
